In view of the fact that the existing YOLO model is difficult to meet peopleâ€™s
needs in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency, especially in
small target detection and complex background, a GFP-YOLO real-time target
detection algorithm based on global convolution addition self attention mechanism (GCAS) and fully aggregated frequency sensing pyramid network structure
(FF-FPN) is proposed.
